## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
In the process of switching carreer after 13 years in the cinema industry as camera assistant.
Currently learning web coding at O'Clock school, I made a bunch of new friends : HTML, CSS, JS, React, PostgreSQL.
I'm looking forward to practicing this new set of skills in a pro environment.
